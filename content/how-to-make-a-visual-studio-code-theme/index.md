# Intro

Hello, I'm back after a 2 week break. Today, we'll be learning over how to make a theme in Visual Studio Code.

I love Visual Studio Themes... maybe a bit *too* much as I have a bit too many installed.

So, in this post we'll be going over how to create the basic boilerplate code for a theme in Visual Studio Code.

# Getting started 🚀

To generate the code, we'll be using a generator called [yeomen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo)

Yeomen is a tool which helps you start off new projects easily.

After installing it globally, then we will have to run the generator

Now, you can open this theme in Visual Studio Code (or your code editor of choice)

Then, you will see all the project files nicely generated

Now, if you go into the JSON files with the theme configurations, you can start to play around with it.

It's quite a long file (629 lines) and I definitely suggest looking over it.

For instance, here's a colours option. Let's tinker with the background colour a bit.

I'll set it to a bright red colour to confirm that it is indeed working.

To see the in action, head over to the debugger section and start debugging.

It will open up a new tab of Visual Studio Code with the theme preview.

Indeed! It's working.

So that's about it for the basics on creating a theme. I plan to tinker around with them a bit and publish my own theme when I get the time. Meanwhile, for me, right now, this is just another side project added to my endless stack
