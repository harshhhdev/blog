# Svelte 💻

So, before we even start, let's get some background with what Svelte even is.

Svelte is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript framework.

As stated on the [Svelte Website](https://svelte.dev/),

"Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.. Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes."

So, for one of my older projects, an [app idea generator](https://github.com/harshhhdev/app-idea-generator), I decided to transition it over from plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Svelte.

# Starting out

At first, things were a bit rocky. I couldn't properly style my web page, but after some digging I figured I had to mess with another file.

In terms of syntax, it's.... pretty decent. I like the on:event keywords and the easy-to-get used to syntax.

I didn't really have a problem to get used to it after that. I didn't go an do anything really complex with this project... basically, it just has 2 arrays, one with audiences, another with an app, and it picks a random thing form both lists and creates an "idea" from it.

Not the coolest thing in the world, but I made it in a day while procrastinating from work, and somehow it is my most starred project (probably due to Hacktoberfest) and it even has 7 contributors.

# What I loved 👍

By far the best thing about Svelte is the sheer simplicity of it whilst not compromising on the DX (developer experience).

I think I will consider using Svelte more and more for really small projects like this one, instead of, say, something like Gatsby or Nuxt.js

The tutorial and documentation for Svelte is also considerably good, especially when taken into account its size.

# Downsides of Svelte 👎

The thing with Svelte right now is that it's very new, and it's not nearly as mature as libraries like React.js or Vue, therefore there are less components, libraries, etc designed for Svelte when compared to these other frameworks.

Due to it being smaller, I also had limited help resources, etc. to work with. It was more looking at docs and figuring out things by myself, which is a good skill to have nonetheless.

I didn't try to use TypeScript here, but, I've read from some sources that it is harder to use TypeScript in Svelte.

# Conclusion

I think I'll come to Conclusion that Svelte is a cool, simple little framework which is, as Ben Awad describes it, the "hot kid" on the block which people are flocking to.

It is not as large as React, and there is limited help on platforms like stackoverflow, and there are less blog posts on how to deal with problems, along with there being fewer libraries for Svelte.

With the sheer advantage of simplicity though, I will suggest that you should try out and consider using Svelte in your smaller projects.
