# UI Assets 🎨

I love using assets to brighten up the look of my UI.

I'm by no means even decent at this kind of stuff, so, using free-to-use art and illustrations are of course the go-to for me (and a lot of other people.)

So, over the different UI assets which I've discovered,

They are mainly 3D assets, though there is an amazing 2D pack in the list as well.

If you just want quick links to them, you can find them here.

<h1 id="sally">Sally 3D Illustrations</h1>

This illustration pack has a lot of great work in it, and this BY FAR has to be my favourite out of the ones in my list.

The looks of the illustrations are just really appealing to me, with the visually soft and soothing appearance.

These illustrations are 100% free and you can also use them for commercial projects.

<h1 id="toy-faces">3D Toy Faces</h1>

Toy Faces is an awesome library with several amazing and diverse toy faces.

This icon pack is really diverse, which I love about it.

It has a paid version as well, for $20 (around ₹1,500)

Along with this, you can even get your custom toy face for $50 (around ₹3,700)

This pack's free, and paid versions can be used in commercial projects.

<h1 id="social-icons">3D Social Media Icons</h1>

This is a pack of a total of 12 free Social Media icons, and come in Figma, PNG along with SVG.

You can use this version for completely free! But you'll be asked to provide a link to their website (https://morqua.store/) where ever you use it.

I believe use in commercial projects may be allowed with attribution, but I could not find any info for this on the website, so don't quote me on what I said. If you're using it in a personal project I advise you to contact the makers of this pack.

<h1 id="kukla">3D Objects</h1>

Kukla is cool 3D icon library, having both a free and a paid version.

The free version has 4 objects with changeable colours, 2 scene angles and 1 character pose.

There is also a paid version, coming in at $48 (around ₹3,500) with 137 objects, changable colours, 2 angles, png files, 4k res, 10 character poses, and glossy + shadow icons.

Along with the previous pack, I couldn't find any info about using these on commercial projects, though it seems you can use them. Again, I advise you not to quote me on what I said, and contact the owners directly if you're using in a commercial project.

<h1 id="slam-pack">SLAM 3D Objects Pack</h1>

Another cool 3D icons object pack to use in your projects.

For the most part, I really like these icons. There are a few icons though which I'm not the biggest fan of, for instance, the iPads and iPhones which in my opinion do not look that good due to the wallpaper on the screen.

These come with PNGs, along with Cinema 4D files!

You MAY NOT use this for commercial native apps, web apps or games. To read up more on this, you can check out the [license](https://craftwork.design/license/)

<h1 id="3d-icons">3 free 3D icons</h1>

Not a super much to say here. It's just a cool and simple little icon pack with 3 cool and good looking icons!

I am not sure if you can use this on commercial projects or not. In the description, it reads

"Feel free to use them for your portfolios and projects 😉"

So, I'm presuming that you can use them on commercial projects. Don't quote me on this though, I may very well be wrong. I would suggest contacting the owner just to be sure.

<h1 id="porto-illustrations">Porto Illustrations</h1>

This is perhaps in my top 3 favourite in this list. I love the creative and crafty aesthetic that this pack has.

It comes with 3 gradient variants, and you have the choice of keeping or removing the background.

It comes with Adobe Illustrator and PNG files.

I believe this can be used in commercial projects, as it says that you can use them for your websites and does not explicitly prohibit commercial use anywhere on the page. Still, if you wish to use this for commercial sites, better to be safe and contact *just in case.*

<h1 id="diversity-avatars">Diversity Avatars</h1>

An amazing set of 59 avatars centred around inclusiveness.

What I love about this is that it reflects people from everywhere, from different cultures around the world.

From people with disabilities, to people expressing their religious/culture, or sexuality through clothes/appearance, this pack has got it all!

It's free to use in commercial projects as well!

<h1 id="handz">3D Hands</h1>

This is amongst my favourite packs in this list as well.

This is also a 'freemium' type pack, which offers a good free demo of the pack.

The free version offers the source files (.blend) and has a total of 320 PNG files!

It includes 12 gestures with 9 skin colours, and 3 sleeve variants.

The premium version on the other hand comes in at $19 (around ₹1,400).

It includes everything in the free version, plus

 - 1,200+ PNG files instead of 320
 - 12 hand gestures with mobile iPhones
 - 4 hand gestures with a tablet/iPad
 - 3 hand gestures with Samsung Gear
 - 3 hand gestures with an Apple Watch
 - 2 Mac screens
 - 2 rings

...along with a tutorial on how to play around with the library.

This library mentions nothing about using in commercial projects on the page, and I couldn't find any restrictions of use on it. To stay safe, if you wish, you can contact them to make sure.
