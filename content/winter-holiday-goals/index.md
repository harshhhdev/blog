# Winter Holiday 🌲

So, my schools Winter Holiday starts on 24/12/20 (which is quite late for most schools in my country) and it is until 03/01/21. It's a good enough time for me to maybe fix up some old projects, and start (and hopefully finish!) some new ones.

# Fixing some old projects 🔩

A project I really wanted to try and fix up is [AwesomeSource](https://awesomesource.herokuapp.com). If you don't know much about it, it's basically a way for people to find and share open source projects easily.

I've had some plans to redo the whole website. The biggest of which includes adding the forum idea along with a way for the people to post their repositories on their profile, similar to [IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io/)

I've made some very minor progress in this. It's not going to be an easy task either, by any means. I'll have to scrap the Google login system, and replace it with a GitHub login. I'll have to get a way for people to post their repositories, and share them, redo user profiles. All of which can be done, but I am lacking the motivation to do it.

What I think is going to happen with this is I'll just work on [AwesomeSource](https://awesomesource.herokuapp.com) in small portions of time, fixing and rebuilding the project bit by bit.

For now, you can view the [figma design board](https://www.figma.com/file/C4kQV0p0aE1TVEODiaIJC7/AwesomeSource?node-id=0%3A1) if you're curious on where what the new version might look like 😉

It's not really finished either, but it's a rough concept which I'll hopefully try to put together.

# New Projects 🤩

We're all more motivated to work on newer projects rather than debugging old ones. The new project I'd like to start is a simple polling app, which I'm going to call "Oponion"

It will be a way for people to make and share simple polls.

I have a *very rough* implementation of this made so far.

The styling is on different levels, *I know.*

But, if you can get the main concept of it, you can basically create polls with different options, titles, descriptions, etc.

I've only started working on this for the past hour or so.

Some cool ideas I have for this are adding cool data visualisation with [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut.html) w/ different colours.

I was wondering, should I add a login system to this? There's two sides to this and I think it's interesting to hear and understand both.

### No Login 🙅‍♂️

I think many people don't want to create a whole account, or even choose a "Login With Google" if they just have to vote on a simple damn poll. It will make it less likely that people will actually use the site to vote on content, as they will have to do login drama over and over. This will lead to an incline in the amount of people who make these polls casually, because let's be honest, with a question like "what's your favourite colour?" nobody will bother to login and out a thousand times.

The main downside to this comes that users can vote again and again. This can unfortunately lead to some cheating in the polls which might draw away a good amount of people.

### Login To Vote 👍

This will make polls secure. People can't just randomly vote a thousand times on a poll to make it lean towards themselves. People will see a better use of this, and might start coming to using this app for larger and more serious polls.

The downside to this will definitely be the turnout of people who vote, which is a factor which might draw some away. If you require a login it will probably come as a side effect that less and less people will take part in the process and polls will be empty. This can draw away people who'll use the app for casual polls which nobody really cares to cheat on.

### My Thoughts 💭

I'm leaning more towards not including a login at all. I don't want people to really use this for serious applications, and even if it was built in that manner I doubt many who make serious polls will actually use it.

If I make it as more of a casual site for polls, then I believe there will be a bigger turnout in the amount of people who partake in votes. In certain cases, I don't think anybody really cares on wining on *most* casual polls.

TDLR; I don't want to include a login system.

If you find a flaw in my point, you can open an contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Harshhhdev) and convince me otherwise.

# Conclusion 📋

So, to sum it up, over Winter Holiday I'd like to try and dab in here and there, and maybe try to fix one of my old projects. I'd also like to work on a new polling app to easily create, share, and vote on content.

What're your goals over your Winter Holiday? I'm interested to know, feel free to tell me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Harshhhdev) 🐦
