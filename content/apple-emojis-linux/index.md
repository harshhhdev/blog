# Emojis on Linux

By default, Linux comes installed with the NotoColorEmoji font, which, in my humble opinion looks a bit inferior to Apple's AppleColorEmoji font.

So, in this quick tutorial, we'll be going over how to get this awesome font installed on your Linux system.

Before we get started, here's a side-by-side comparison of emoji font across different platforms.

Linux is represented by "Google" in the chart below

I'm curious to see which emoji you think looks the best. In my opinion, it goes Apple > Microsoft > Google > Samsung.

# Getting started

So, first off lets go to this [GitHub repo.](https://github.com/samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux)

As said in the readme, let's head over to [releases](https://github.com/samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux/releases).

Click to install the AppleColorEmoji.ttf file.

When it's installed, you'll have to copy it over and replace it with your previous emoji file.

For Ubuntu 2020.10, you can go there by

Now, let's uninstall our NotoColorEmoji.ttf file.

Now, we need to copy over our fonts from our directory we installed them from to this

Now, let's logout of our system.

Log back in, head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.com/) and you should see Apple emojis on your Linux system!

That's it for today. If this was able to help you, I'm glad.
