# Hi There 👋

My name is Harsh Singh. I'm currently in 9th grade, and am balancing school with coding. I love making web applications. All of my work is open source, and I also enjoy designing websites.

When I'm not coding or designing, I'm usually doing homework, sleeping, playing games, or playing with friends.

Right now, it's really cold, and unfortunately I can't go outside due to the freezing temperatures in Upstate New York, and due to coronavirus (which, let's hope ends soon!) my time with friends and others has been severely limited.

# My New Website 🎨

This is my new website, and I was desperate to change it. The old website looked something like this 👇

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69592270/101999176-66b14d00-3ca8-11eb-99a6-a0e0a2e941bd.png" alt="Old Website" style="width:100%;" />

It was... _really_ bad. What I showed above was probably the best thing in the entire web page.

Not only this, but the website was clustered with poorly written and rushed code, horrible SEO, horrible colours, horrible UX, was uninteractive and boring to look at aswell.

Take the example above. It's just a bunch of _really boring_ text which nobody's ever going to read.

Now, let's move onto my new website.

In my humble thoughts, it's _exponentially_ better than my previous one. It's inspired by a similar one on [Brittany Chiang]'s website.

There's a cool graphic, a small summary, tags, a cleaner layout, and others. Compare this to the previous one which had a essay on what my project was, and was boring to look at. People will just see it, and skip it over.

So, I took some time out and spent 2 weeks designing, and building my new portfolio website, this time, adding a blog.

The previous website was built with raw HTML and CSS 🤮

My current one is built using GatsbyJS and TypeScript, and this blog runs on Abelljs (created by the amazing [@saurabhcodes])

I really wanted to do make this portfolio website good. I borrowed small elements and ideas from lots of websites, most notable ones of [Anurag Hazra], [Brittany Chiang], and [Harshit Pant].

I added cool things, like a dark mode, and a blog! I'm really happy with how this has turned out, and the constructive feedback from my friends has shaped it well.

You can check out my new website's homepage [here]

I'd be glad to hear your thoughts on it. You can DM me on my [Twitter] with them, or open an issue on the [GitHub].

# My tech blog 🗒️

I also plan to continue writing my weekly blog in the [dev community], which will be more related to web development/coding. My blogs on this website might feature tech sometimes, but more often will be more personal.

# Wrapping up 😪

If you made it down here, I'm glad! Thanks for taking your time out to read. I hope you have a nice day or night, and stay safe during this unfortunate coronavirus pandemic. Hope to see you soon ✌️
