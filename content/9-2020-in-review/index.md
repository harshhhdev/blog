# 2020 😷

2020 is by far the craziest year of most peoples lives, I know for sure it was the craziest year of mines.

This year took a drastic turn and it has been such a crazy journey which I hope will comes to an end with the start of this new year.

I have high hopes for this year, though I fear that they might not live up.

In this post, I'll share my recap, my achievements, the positives, and the negatives of this year so far.

# Accomplishments 🤗

Let's start with positivity!

So, this year was my BIGGEST leap forward for me in terms of programming.

I got *really* started with JavaScript. Last year was mainly spent on watching random HTML and CSS videos and not completing projects. This year changed all of that.

I started this year off with a focus on web development, then I tried out game development for a while starting from February.

Doing game development was cool, but it isn't really for me.

Often times I find it really boring to do. It is such a long and tedious task which to me feels punishing at times.

There's just so many steps. Make appealing and good looking art, write code, design levels, make sound effects, make music, and so on.

If you are interested in doing a wide field of things, then sure, go ahead, game development is for you.

For me, I'd rather just skip half of those things as they are super boring and unappealing to me.

So, after trying out game development for a long while, I switched back to what I had started with. Web.

I got back into the web development zone rather smoothly and fast, and I made several web projects.

This year was a HUGE leap forward to me in programming and I am proud of it.

So, let's put my achievements in a long and boring list which nobody probably cares about...

# My Final Thoughts on 2020 😶

I'm, in a way, glad that 2020 has happened. It was a huge year for me in terms of personal development which I'm *really* happy with!

But it was not like this for all. Many had lost their loved ones, many had lost their jobs, homes and businesses. I am lucky enough not have those situations and I am really thankful for it.

We were told that there was no school for a week on 16 March 2020, we thought it would be a temporary thing. Boy were we wrong.

This coronavirus pandemic has had an mainly impact on my academics. Due to me not being in school I was *far* more prone to procrastinating my studies.

I however saw growth in certain subjects which I was happy with. Overall, it did not really help or hurt my grades.

I gained knowledge and grew overall, which I am happy with!

I hope that 2021 is an year of even bigger change and development. I have high hopes for this year, let's hope it lives up to them!

Happy holidays, and stay safe.
